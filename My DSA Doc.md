Sol??   
**Method 1**\-For recursive version   
At particular ind if i am at then there are 3 possibility  
\-subarray for ans i left not including ith  
\-subarray for ans is right not including ith  
\-subarray is including ith index

**Method1.1** this further go to 2d dp iterative version 

**Method 1.2 this lead to standard recursive one kadane algo**

**Method 2** is using prefix sum from l to r source codingmohan  
**Method 2.1** method 2 can further optimize in o(1) space

**Method 3** using dp vector find the maxi sum at ending at ith index   
is medium article which is this **Good article on this  best method :[https://medium.com/@rsinghal757/kadanes-algorithm-dynamic-programming-how-and-why-does-it-work-3fd8849ed73d](https://medium.com/@rsinghal757/kadanes-algorithm-dynamic-programming-how-and-why-does-it-work-3fd8849ed73d)**

**Method 3.1** further optimizes method 3 to o(1) space easily.

1.WHEN WE DO int a then in memory it stores in binary form when we print it it gives an exact number.  
2.MSB is the most significant bit of any numbers binary representation is the first digit of the representation exam 2=10 so 1 is the MSB of 2\.  
3.If 0 MSB the positive number simple if 1 MSB the nb is negative find 2s complement \=1s complement \+1 in that and it will be negative number.example (10000)’’ \= 10000’+1 add negative also

**Ques preorder traversal**  
[**https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/**](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/)  
**Sol?? Method 1 using recursion easy**   
**Method 2 without recursion iterative how ???**  
**Use of stack why?? Because of recursion**   
**Method 3 is morris traversal**

**Ques post order traversal**  
[**https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/**](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)  
**Sol??**  
**Method 1**  
**Method 2 Use of pre order how think  in preorder we print node first here we print last**   
**In preorder  order is node left right.for post order left right node if we reverse it node right left  then ans will be reverse we can now do post order using same as preorder traversal iterative way.**  
**Method 3 morris traversal**

**Ques inorder traversal**  
**Sol??**   
**Method 1 is recursion easy**  
**Method 2 is using two stack how think in inorder when we visit for the second time we print so 2nd stack with store the no of time we visited or not**  
**Method 3 using one stack only**   
**Method 4 using morris traversal**   
**Make node to traverse back left node right**  
**//pseudo code**  
**if(left not exist) simple print node go to left**  
**If left exist**   
   **check traverse or not**  
   **If not traverse create link to root**  
   **Go to the root left**  
   **Else unlink the link print node go to the right**
